# Software Quality Engineering - System Testing

This is a repository for the system-testing assignment of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called [openCart](https://www.opencart.com).

OpenCart is an open-source e-commerce platform that allows users to create their own online stores. It is written in PHP and uses a MySQL database. OpenCart provides a user-friendly interface for managing products, orders, and customers. It also supports multiple languages and currencies, making it suitable for international businesses. The platform includes a variety of features such as:

- A customizable storefront
- Multiple payment gateways
- Shipping methods
- Extensions and themes to enhance functionality and appearance
- SEO-friendly URLs
- Multi-store management

OpenCart is widely used due to its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive community support.
